# Logisim-8-bit-TOY-CPU
The TOY-8 CPU is an attempt at a simple 8-bit CPU, capable of basic arithmetic. The project started as a group effort for the students enrolled in the ITC course at IBA. Therefore, the main CPU is the result of an extensive group collaboration, whereas the Interface has been built by me (although it *does* take influence from other works)
